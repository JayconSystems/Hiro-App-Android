An example would be if you are constantly getting away from your Hiro in your home (from bedroom to garage), but do not want to get disconnect notifications.
\nNote that you will still be able to buzz your Hiro at any time as long as they are both in range. If they are not in range, you will be able to see its last disconnection location from the pin dropped on the map.</string>
